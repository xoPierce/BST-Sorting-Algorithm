# CS-300-Portfolio-Submission

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem that was being solved in the main projects was determining what data structure would be best to sort, store, print, and access different Course objects. I ended up utilizing a binary search tree for my method here due to the ability to sort the Course objects as they are inserted in to the tree and the overall speed of the data structure. 

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
My approach was to analyze the most common data structures and complete a Big O analysis to determine which would be most efficient for my system. Data structures are essential to understand because they are used very frequently within software developement. The better I can understand how the data structures work, the easier it is to implement them and use them as a tool during the developement process. 

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The major roadblock I had was learning all of the most common data structure and the different methods to sort, access, insert, delete, and print within these different data structure in such a short amount of time. The way I was able to overcome this roadblock was long hours of studying and coding until I was able to actually understand how the different data structures actually work. 

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I will definitely consider ALL of the different data structures moving forward with future programs. Up to this point I have always stuck with what I was most comfortable with and not necessarily what was the most efficient or the 'best' option for the given program. Overall it has changed my outlook on taking a step back and really trying to analyze what is best for the project and design the program before just jumping straight in a starting to code right away. 

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has allowed me to grow and adapt to using some of the most common data structures. Since I am more comfortable implimentint these different data structure this will end up making my future code more adaptable, readable and maintainable.
